Welcome

Hey everyone,

This is the first executor I've created after a lot of practice, and I'm excited to share it with you! It has 80% UNC, thanks to Flornicus’s ForlornApi, which allows you to run most scripts smoothly and safely. I guarantee there's nothing harmful in it—just a tool to enhance your experience. The UI is sleek and modern, and you can easily clear the code box to start fresh. You can also open and save your scripts directly within the executor or wherever you prefer. On the left side, there's a built-in script folder where you can access your saved scripts with just a click—they'll instantly appear in the code box again!

I'm also working on setting up a Discord server, and I'll share the link here as soon as it's ready.

Upcoming/Possible Updates
--------------------------
Tabbed system with Monaco or an even better code editor!
