Hi everyone

This is my first executor I ever mad with practice this executor has 80 unc with help of Flornicus's ForlornApi which helps you run most scripts and it is completely safe i would never do anything harmful or mean i promise the ui is sleek and mordern
you can clear your code box to start over your open and save scripts to the scripts built in the executor or save it anywhere you like speaking of built in script folder on left of the executor you can see the scripts you saved and just click on them to see them in the code box once again!

i am in progress of making a discord server i will put the link here soon
